This is a React Router based project named "EPL Soccer League".

Here i have used useEffect & useState to Load Data & Set Data from https://thesportsdb.com/api.php
The homepage is full of some EPL Teams Card.
In every Card, there is the team logo, an Explore Button & the Team sport type.
I have also used Dynamic routing system to navigate from one page to another page through the "Explore" button.
The next page shows the details of the team which clicked.
